# Dual Screen PDF Viewer
This project is a Python port of dspdfviewer(https://github.com/dannyedel/dspdfviewer) created as the original project has stalled, with no new releases/commits in a few years and many outstanding PRs.

Unlike the original which was designed as a fast PDF renderer which can be used for presentations, this port will be focused entirely on being a presentation tool, so I will be prioritising features which aid presentations.

At the current time, most of the features available in the original have been built, some of the key bindings are not yet implemented and some function slightly differently. I've also not built any of the command line flags that the original supports.

Going foward, I intend to build an initial configuration dialog screen which will allow selecting the PDF to view and changing display options, choosing which screen to place things on etc. This config will be saved for future uses and mean that the command line flags are no longer required.
